## ERIC MOORE

  I'm a Navy veteran from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier. I've traveled to many ports of call in the Mediterean sea. After moving back to my home South Carolina I completed my bachelors in Business and wanted to pursue my MBA ,but realized that higher education doesn't always land you the job you would like. So wanting a flexible schedule I decided to pursue my real estate license. I'm looking for a chance to learn how to create web pages that can give the browser a excellent experience.
